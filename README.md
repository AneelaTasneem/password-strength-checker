# 🔐 Password Strength Checker

A simple **Password Strength Checker** built with **Python & Streamlit**. It analyzes passwords based on security rules, assigns a strength score, and provides feedback to improve weak passwords. Also includes a **random strong password generator**.

## 🚀 Features
✅ Checks password strength based on:
- Length (minimum 8 characters)
- Uppercase & lowercase letters
- At least one digit (0-9)
- At least one special character (!@#$%^&*)

✅ **Scoring System:**
- **Weak (1-2):** Missing key security features
- **Moderate (3-4):** Good but needs improvement
- **Strong (5):** Meets all security criteria

✅ Suggests a **strong password** if the entered password is weak.  
✅ Built with **Streamlit** for a simple and interactive UI.
